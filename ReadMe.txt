for CNN and MLP:
u can directly run the program on google colabs and if u wish to change no of epoch 
go on the 8th line of CNN and 7th line of MLP and make sure to change the range of epochs on the last line such as :
for epochs =5 , range = (1,6)
for epochs =20 , range = (1,21)
and so on.....


for KNN u can change the n_neighbors on the 4th line
